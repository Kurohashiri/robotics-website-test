  This is a website where I put stuff I guess. Honestly I'm learning to code for my own benefit and the benefit of others. I've always been interested in coding due to my extensive hours in video games and was always curious on how game desing and technology works. Hopefully I'll use these skills to make apps and games, the first of which is probably a bad Unity game or Clash of Clash ripoff #472.
  
  I'm now going to make an agenda post against the states of Florida and Ohio. Florida sounds really bad to live in, given the headlines that its residents makes as well as the abundance of hurricanes and humid climate it has. Plus, I don't want an alligator in my backyard. Ohio also sucks given its cold blizzards and that it's basically the Florida of the Midwest. Also, I assume there is a lack of jobs there due to their cities relying on manufacturing perhaps way too much. SO yeah, Florida bad, Ohio bad, California good.
